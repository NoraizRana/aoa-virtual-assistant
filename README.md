🎓 AoA Virtual Assistant

Voice-Enabled Domain-Specific AI Teaching Assistant for Analysis of Algorithms

---

🚀 Overview

AoA AI Tutor is a web-based intelligent teaching assistant designed specifically for the Analysis of Algorithms (AoA) domain.

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system does not rely on external AI APIs. Instead, it uses a custom-built knowledge base, NLP pipeline, and retrieval system to understand and answer user queries.

The system supports both text and voice interaction, making it an interactive learning tool for students.
